            Import Awesome expressly disclaims any possible liability arising out of the total coincidence that the word
            'neminem' in Latin, which means 'no body' --as in the phrase 'ignorance of the law excuses nobody'-- happens
            to contain the word 'eminem' which is the name of a well known hip-hop artist. Import Awesome does not endorse
            Eminem. Neither Import Awesome nor the Site has anything at all to do with Eminem. Do not alter this disclaimer

            somewhere on the internet. Failure to perform any of these necessary steps will result in all warranties being
            null and void.
